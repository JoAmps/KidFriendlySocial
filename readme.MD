# Project Name
### KidFriendlySocial: Making social media safe amd fun for kids

# Project Intro/Objective
With the rise of social media use among younger generations, it is important to ensure that the content they are exposed to is appropriate and free from harmful language.

KidFriendlySocial is a web application designed to promote safe online social interactions for children. With the increasing use of social media by children, it is essential to provide a platform that can filter out inappropriate language in their tweets, thereby promoting a healthy online environment.

KidFriendlySocial addresses this need by utilizing a predictive model and a generative model built using machine learning techniques to identify tweets that contain bad language content. The app flags these tweets, alerting the user of the potentially harmful content, and then offers recommendations on how to rephrase their tweets that are more kid-friendly or appropriate for children. This feature helps children become more aware of what is acceptable and unacceptable online behavior, making them better digital citizens.

Moreover, the recommendations aspect is particularly useful, as it helps children learn how to express themselves appropriately while still being creative with their language. This feature will help build their writing skills and promote a positive online environment for children.
